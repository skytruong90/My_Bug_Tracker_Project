# Title: Bug Tracker Project
### I worked on this by myself in order to push my limit and the code was build using C# and dot net.  

## How to install:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/skytruong90/My_Bug_Tracker_Project.git
2. The main code is inside the code folder when you download everything.
3. Run the project with any IDE.

## My Objective: 
### To create a bug tracker that would logged and monitoried bugs or errors during software testing. Large systems may have hundreds or thousands of defects. Each needs to be evaluated, monitored and prioritized for debugging.
